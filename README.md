We communicated through the messaging app "GroupMe" and decided who were to take which roles.
I contributed by doing what they asked of me. It was difficult for me to respond to them on the app because I am not allowed to be on my phone at work and that's when they did a lot of the role distribution. 
When I would get caught up on the messages I told them to tell me what to do and I would complete that portion.
