# NeelyBoard
Vanbawi had enough time right after the assignment
was posted, so they went ahead and made a very basic
template and opened the GitHub that we all used.

We all communicated over GroupMe and Canvas, which
is how we shared our files and such (along with 
GitHub). 

We each took an almost-equal amount of words for the
assignment: Vanbawi, Elijah, and Myself each did 5, and
Ben doing 4 because there wasn't an even number. We 
each used the basic template and made our correct number
of cards, each writing our own text and choosing our
own images.
